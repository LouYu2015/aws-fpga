    "First Begin with getting a FNAL account, and then contact Burt (email:burt@fnal.gov or via cms-aws-ml channel in Slack) to setup an F1 instance with either: \n",
    "1. Xilinx ML AMI\n",
    "or\n",
    "2. Ubuntu 16.04 AMI\n",
    "\n",
    "AMI is short forAmazon Machine Image.\n",
    "I would recommend you to choose the second option since I learned from Xilinx team that the latest release of Xilinx ML Suite is based on a docker container. Follow the next part to install Xilinx ML suite docker image.    \n",
    "\n",
    "AS for the first option, next steps could be found in Jessica's tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Xilinx ML Suite via docker\n",
    "##### Steps \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Launch an instance using the Ubuntu 16.04 AMI from the AWS Marketplace\n",
    "2. Disable the auto-upgrades (If not disabled, the XRT installed will break if the kernel gets updated. Which requires re-install of XRT)\n",
    "   Edit “/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades” as below:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\";\n",
    "    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\";\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. run “sudo apt-get update” to update the package list\n",
    "4. Install Docker on Ubuntu (I followed the steps in here [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://mmm.cern.ch/owa/redir.aspx?C=eURkoxK39z-8AZXGyyPZZV7Jgb5hdJA1CIiWc09xBcAVcIQEMibXCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fwww.digitalocean.com%2fcommunity%2ftutorials%2fhow-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)):\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. Add GPG Key for the official Docker repository to the instance: \n",
    "  \n",
    "     ``` bash\n",
    "     curl -fsSL [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg]| sudo apt-key add –\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Add the Docker repository to APT sources:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ``` bash\n",
    "     sudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu]$(lsb_release -cs) stable\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo apt-get update\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ``` bash\n",
    "     apt-cache policy docker-ce\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. Install Docker:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Check if Docker is running:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo systemctl status docker\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  7. To execute Docker without Sudo:\n",
    "  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "5. Steps to install XRT on Ubuntu on AWS (Run these commands in bash terminal):\n",
    "   1. git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git\n",
    "   2. cd aws-fpga\n",
    "   3. git clone -b 2018.2_XDF.RC5 https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT.git\n",

    "   6. source sdaccel_setup.sh  #Even if it fails no worries, the point is to generate 'aws-fpga/sdk/userspace/lib/libfpga_mgmt.a'. lib directory under userspace doesn't exist when aws-fpga is cloned \n",
    "   7. XRT/src/runtime_src/tools/scripts/xrtdeps.sh  #install XRT dependencies\n",
    "   8. cd XRT/build\n",
    "   9. ./build.sh\n",
    "   10. sudo dpkg -i xrt_201802.2.1.0_16.04-xrt.deb\n",
    "       sudo dpkg -i xrt_201802.2.1.0_16.04-aws.deb\n",

    "6. Download, and/or scp Xilinx ML Suite Docker Image to instance\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sign up an account and download the image: https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/eula-xef.html?filename=xilinx-ml-suite-ubuntu-16.04-xrt-2018.2-caffe-mls-1.4.tar.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: cannot `wget` directly. After accecpting the Xilinx End User License Agreement, then  I copy the download link from the browser and use `wget` command \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Load the image\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker load -i xilinx-ml-suite-ubuntu-16.04-xrt-2018.2-caffe-mls-1.4.tar.gz\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Start the container with a script\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ./docker_run.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   see docker_run.sh in the next part. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#####  Tips:\n",
    "1. One may encounter the error `no space left on device`, if this happens, you could ask Burt to insert another disk and mount it somewhere you like, and then tell Docker to put the images onto that mount point.   \n",
    "   edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, more details could be found: https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need to learn some basic operations about Docker. Here I just post some ideas.   \n",
    "   If you want keep the modifications after exiting a container and get back, you need to remove the option `--rm` in the script `docker_run.sh`(see below). and then `docker container ls -a` to get the container id and `docker container restart <id>`,`docker attach <id>`. However, this will not load the drivers, so write a new script with parts of loading the drivers and restart the container. \n",
    "   More details could be found in docker doc. \n",

    "I tried to test the latency of AWS as edge service and cloud service. \n",
    "For the edge service, I got some stange results from the XDNN pipeline report. The expert explained that differences may be related to the set up (included HW).\n",
    "For the cloud service, I followed the tutorial to start REST API on local instance, where I can send images to the localhost to do inference and measure the time, which is not the real cloud service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you could start with learning these tools and verify my results in the talk, and then start to do top jet classification, finally compare the performance with Microsft Azure in the paper. "
